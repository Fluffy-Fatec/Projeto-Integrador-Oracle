## Challenge

In this challenge, you will have the opportunity to create an online platform that will allow restaurant owners to manage their operations in an efficient and intuitive way. The objective is to create a comprehensive system that offers resources such as control panels, graphs, reports and functionalities for managing personnel, suppliers and inputs.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">Scroll to top</a>)</p>

<li>Functional Requirements</li>
<ul>
      <li>Develop an organizational panel of personnel and suppliers and inputs;</li>
      <li>Develop an employee flow dashboard, people flow, inventory, best selling dishes;</li>
      <li>Develop a comparator of customers x staff x stock, another comparator of predictability of inputs for preparing dishes;</li>
      <li>In the comparator, check the inputs and present what needs to be purchased, in the personnel comparator, consider the flow of customers.</li>
</ul>

<li>Non-Functional Requirements</li>
<ul>
      <li>The website's response time must be below 1000ms in 99.99% of the requests;</li>
      <li>The application's logging mechanism must generate the trails in JSON format (optional);</li>
      <li>The system must contain metrics that help to observe its behavior: Quantity of requests, response time, quantity and percentage of failures when obtaining data from Golden Sources.</li>
</ul>

## Solution

The Fluffy team will develop a web system that will allow the management of inputs and employees, as well as providing visualization of processed data so that the business owner can manage their sales, stocks, work team and project their future actions.

Aiming to solve the project, the system will be delivered in four sprints:


| Sprint                  | Need      | Product         |
| ------------------------| -------------|-------------|
|Sprint 1                 | Visualization of the establishment's Sales data | System developed with functionalities for inserting data related to sales via .csv files and viewing them through various graphs and dynamic filters. |
|Sprint 2                 | Visualization and management of the establishment's Suppliers data, visualization of reports for future decision making. | System developed with functionalities for inserting data related to suppliers and viewing them through various graphs and dynamic filters. The payment part and reports for data comparisons were also developed. |
|Sprint 3                 | Visualization and management of the establishment's Inputs and Stock data, visualization of comparators for predictability. | System developed with functionalities for inserting data related to inputs and stock, as well as viewing them through various graphs and dynamic filters. It was also implemented the input predictability comparator. |
|Sprint 4                 | Visualization and management of the establishment's Employees data, comparison of customers x employees x stock, access level. | System will be developed with functionalities for inserting data related to employees and also visualizing them through various graphs and dynamic filters. A comparator of customers x employees x stock, and system access levels will also be implemented. |
